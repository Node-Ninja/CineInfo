# CineInfo

CineInfo allows you to view information about your favorite movies, latest movies, and everything else movie related. It also allows you to create a list of your favorite movies which you can reference anytime you want to.

* TMDB API key: You can get this at The Movie Database website (https://www.themoviedb.org/). All you need to do is to create a profile there.
